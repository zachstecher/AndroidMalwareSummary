Summary:

- The summary is sufficient and with good quality.


\LaTeX:

- When writing \LaTeX, try to keep every line of text within 80 characters or
  100 at the most, then continue in a new line, \LaTeX will continue if you
  break lines.

- It seems like you tried one of the most complicated things in \LaTeX, which
  is to produce graphics using tkizpicture. But the figure element is missing!

- The usage of figures is incomplete. Usually figures have a caption that
  describes the content of the figure. What you are doing is simply add a
  picture with tkizpicture, but you needed to add a figure element to it.

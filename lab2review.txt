Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the incorrect format. It shows the result in
  lowercase format, it should be all upper case. Your program gives:
$ java Driver < testcase.txt
5468617473206D79204B756E67204675  <-- upper case, good.
e232fcf191129188b159e4e6d679a293  <-- lower case, no good.
56082007c71ab18f76435569a03af7fa  <-- lc



Style:

- Both files have style problems. You are not following all the style
  guidelines.

- There is incorrect indentation in the aescipher file

- Good block comments

- Both files have incorrect method header formatting. Each function must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes each
  parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example:
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

- Both files are missing class block comments. Each class declaration must have
  a comment block before it, which gives the class name and describes the
  purpose of the class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
    // ...
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- When searching the Sbox or Rcon you are constantly parsing integers. Perhaps
  it would be more efficient to have them as integers already and save
  constantly parsing.
